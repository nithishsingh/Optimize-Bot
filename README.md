# How I created a chatbot using Power App for NielsenIQ

NielsenIQ is a global leader in providing data and insights for consumer goods and retail industries. They offer various solutions to help brands and retailers understand their customers, markets, and trends. One of their solutions is NielsenIQ Activate, which is a unique SaaS platform that leverages AI to take retail media programs from insights to actions to measurements.

As a developer working for NielsenIQ, I was tasked with creating a chatbot that can interact with our clients and provide them with relevant information about Optimize. The chatbot should be able to answer common questions, provide demos, and guide users through the features and benefits of the platform.

I decided to use Power App as my tool for creating the chatbot, because it is an easy and fast way to build powerful apps without writing code. Power App is part of the Microsoft Power Platform, which also includes Power Automate, Power BI, and Power Virtual Agents. Power Virtual Agents is a service that allows anyone to create intelligent chatbots using a graphical interface.

Here are the steps I followed to create my chatbot using Power App:

1. To create a chatbot, I selected Chatbots from the left navigation pane in Power App, then Create, and then New chatbot. This took me directly to the Power Virtual Agents portal where I could create my chatbot.
2. I gave my chatbot a name (optimize Bot) and chose an environment (Production) where it would be stored.
3. I customized my chatbot's greeting message, personality traits, and language settings.
4. I used topics to define what my chatbot can talk about with users. Topics are like conversations that have triggers (words or phrases that users say), conditions (rules that determine when topics are relevant), entities (variables that capture user input), messages (what the bot says), actions (what the bot does), and nodes (steps in the conversation flow).
5. I created several topics for my chatbot based on common scenarios that our clients might encounter when using Optimize bot. For example, one topic was about how to launch campaigns on different channels using Optimize bot.
6. I tested my chatbot using the Test your bot panel on the right side of the screen. I typed some sample questions and checked how my bot responded.
7. I published my chatbot so it could be available for users on various channels such as web, mobile app, Teams, etc.
8. I added analytics to my chatbot so I could monitor its performance and improve it over time.

Creating a chatbot using Power App was an enjoyable and rewarding experience for me as a developer. It allowed me to build an engaging conversational interface for our clients without writing any code or having any AI expertise. It also enabled me to integrate my chatbot with other services such as Power Automate and Power BI for more advanced functionality.
